<p>Graduated from National Taiwan University with a bachelor degree of Information Management in 2014. After returning from an half year exchange program in Sweden, I joined IBM Global Business Services(aka GBS) as an application consultant in 2015, whose primary job is to work with clients across different kinds of businesses and industries to delivery projects that provide exceptional business value to clients. </p>

<p>As a application consultant mainly focusing on mobile development and integration, I design, develop, implement and test mobile application with scalability and stability for clients.</p>

<p>I enjoy discussing ideas, sharing knowledge, advice and insights with others because I strongly believe in what Bill Nye once said</p>
<blockquote>Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, I get a chance to better structure my knowledge and express in a more systematic way</>
