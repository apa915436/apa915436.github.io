<p>CodePath partners with Girls in Tech Taiwan to provide an 8-week accelerated android program. I volunteered to be one of the organizer. Here is my material for seconde week, the topic I'm gonna talk about is user interaction and flows, which will cover some simple concepts of action bars, snack bar, toast, event listners and intents.</p>
